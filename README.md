## Introduction
The uber.csv file is a dataset containing information about ride-sharing trips. It has 150,000 entries and provides detailed data for each ride, which can be used to analyze various aspects of the business.

Here's a breakdown of the key information included in the file:

* Ride Details: The dataset contains essential trip information such as the Date and Time of the booking, the Pickup Location and Drop Location, the Vehicle Type used, and the Ride Distance.

* Financial and Performance Metrics: Columns like Booking Value, Avg VTAT (Vehicle Travel and Arrival Time), and Avg CTAT (Customer Travel and Arrival Time) provide insights into the financial aspects and efficiency of the trips.

* Customer and Driver Data: It includes unique **Customer ID**s and ratings for both the Driver Ratings and Customer Rating, which can be used to analyze satisfaction levels.

* Trip Status: The file tracks the outcome of each booking with the Booking Status column, along with detailed information on Cancelled Rides by Customer, Cancelled Rides by Driver, and Incomplete Rides, including the reasons for these events.

* Payment: The Payment Method column details how each ride was paid for.

The dataset contains numerous missing values, particularly in the columns related to ratings and average times. These need to be handled before performing a comprehensive analysis.

### Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
```python
import pandas as pd

# Load the dataset
df = pd.read_csv("datasets/uber.csv")

# Comine "Date" and "Time" columns and convert to datetime
df["Trip Datetime"] = pd.to_datetime(df["Date"] + " " + df["Time"])
df = df.drop(columns= ["Date","Time"])

# Clean "Booking ID" and "Customer ID" columns by removing extra double quotes
df["Booking ID"] = df["Booking ID"].str.strip('\"')
df["Customer ID"] = df["Customer ID"].str.strip('\"')

# Handle missing values 
df["Avg VTAT"] = df["Avg VTAT"].fillna(0)
df["Avg CTAT"] = df["Avg CTAT"].fillna(0)
df["Cancelled Rides by Customer"] = df["Cancelled Rides by Customer"].fillna(0)
df["Reason for cancelling by Customer"] = df["Reason for cancelling by Customer"].fillna("Customer didn't cancel the ride")
df["Cancelled Rides by Driver"] = df["Cancelled Rides by Driver"].fillna(0)
df["Driver Cancellation Reason"] = df["Driver Cancellation Reason"].fillna("Driver didn't cancel the ride")
df["Incomplete Rides"] = df["Incomplete Rides"].fillna(0)
df["Incomplete Rides Reason"] = df["Incomplete Rides Reason"].fillna("No Incomplete Ride")
df["Booking Value"] = df["Booking Value"].fillna(0)
df["Ride Distance"] = df["Ride Distance"].fillna(0)
df["Driver Ratings"] = df["Driver Ratings"].fillna(0)
df["Customer Rating"] = df["Customer Rating"].fillna(0)
df["Payment Method"] = df["Payment Method"].fillna("Customer didn't pay")

# Save the cleaned dataset
df.to_csv("datasets/uber_cleaned.csv")
print("Saved Successfully")
```
### Analysis
Based on the uber.csv dataset, here are 10 analytical questions you can solve using the pandas library:

1. What are the top 5 most popular Pickup Location and Drop Location pairs, and what is the total number of rides for each?

2. What is the average Booking Value for each Vehicle Type?

3. How many rides were Completed, Cancelled Rides by Customer, or Cancelled Rides by Driver in total?

4. What is the average Customer Rating for each Payment Method?

5. What is the total number of rides and the average Ride Distance for each day of the week?

6. Which Pickup Location has the highest number of No Driver Found rides?

7. What is the distribution of Booking Status for each Vehicle Type?

8. Find the Customer ID with the highest number of rides and their total Booking Value.

9. What is the average Avg VTAT (Vehicle Travel and Arrival Time) and Avg CTAT (Customer Travel and Arrival Time) for completed rides that have a Driver Rating of 4.5 or higher?

10. How many rides were incomplete due to a Vehicle Breakdown, and what was the average Ride Distance for those rides?
